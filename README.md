# Ordjakten

Ordjakten is Swedish and translates to "The Word Hunt".


## The Game

Ordjakten is a game inspired by the classic game of "hang man", that I created for a school assignment. The assignment was to create a educational, web based game with javaScript, html and css.

The objective of the game is to correctly guess what word the game is "thinking of" (or more specifically, what word the game has randomly selected from a array of words). To guess the word, you just click on a letter you suspect is in that word, if you are correct, then all instances of that letter in the word are revealed. However, if you are wrong, you lose a life (you get 12, 8 or 6 lives based on the selected difficulty).

If you successfully solve every letter of the word, you win! If your lives go down to zero, you lose. The game keeps count on how many times in a row you've won during the current session, so you can challenge your friends to see who can get's the best high score.

Or you could just [play the game (in Swedish)](http://jarnehall.github.com/ordjakten) to try it out for yourself.
